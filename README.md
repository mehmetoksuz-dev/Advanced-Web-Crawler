# Advanced-Web-Crawler

Desktop-based multi-threaded web crawler

• This program is supporting crawl multiple websites at the same time.
• How many tasks to run at the same time can be set.
• You can see the statistics(real-time) during the crawling.
• I used HashSet and Dictionary instead of lists.
• Also, I used functions inside a class for database operations. In this way, I avoided code duplication(DRY).
